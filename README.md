This is a simple library management system that I wrote in java. When purchasing a new book, there is no upfront cost, but a daily tax of Rs. 5 applies. If the number of days exceeds 15, the tax increases to Rs. 10. Similarly, if the number of days exceeds 30, it becomes Rs. 15, and so on. If you forget to pay the tax, we will automatically deduct the amount from your bank balance. If you don't have the necessary funds, the book will be automatically reclaimed.
